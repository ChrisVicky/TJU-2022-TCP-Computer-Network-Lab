% \chapter{Q\&A}

% \section{The Basic HTTP GET/response interaction}



% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the  server running?
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} Both are running HTTP version 1.1 
    
%     \item What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept to the server?
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} 简体中文（繁体），英文（US）。
    
%     \item What is the IP address of your computer? Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?

%     \textbf{Answer:}\\
%     My Computer: $172.23.170.212$\\
%     Server: $128.119.245.12$

%     \item What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} Status Code: 200

%     \item What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} Last-Modified: Sun, 13 Mar 2022 06:59:02 GMT

%     \item How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} 128 bytes

%     \item By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, do you see any headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} No

% \end{enumerate}


% \section{The HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/response interaction}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[8] Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the 
%     server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?

%     \textbf{Answer:} We see no "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" line in the HTTP GET.

%     \item[9] Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the 
%     contents of the file? How can you tell?

%     \textbf{Answer:} Yes, it did. We may see the whole HTML file in the content field. (Which shall be shown in the appendix section)

%     \item[10]  Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to 
%     the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? If 
%     so, what information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?

%     \textbf{Answer:} No we do see that line. Information: "Sun, 13 Mar 2022 06:59:02 GMT", which is same in the preview response, "Last-Modified" line.

%     \item[11] What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to 
%     this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? 
%     Explain

%     \textbf{Answer:} \textbf{Status Code: }304, \textbf{Phrase: }Not Modified.\\
%     The server did not explicitly return the contents of the file. Because the file is not modified since a specific time which makes it unnecessary to return too much information.

% \end{enumerate}

% \section{Retrieving Long Documents}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[12] How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet 
%     number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?

%     \textbf{Answer:} 1 Get request was sent by my browser. The first one.

%     \item[13]  Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated 
%     with the response to the HTTP GET request?

%     \textbf{Answer:} The first packet contains those informations. 

%     \item[14] What is the status code and phrase in the response?
    
%     \textbf{Answer:} \textbf{Status Code:} 200, \textbf{Phrase:} OK.
    
%     \item[15] How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP 
%     response and the text of the Bill of Rights?

%     \textbf{Answer:} There were 4 TCP segments in the HTTP response. Since it takes up for 4500 bytes and the first segment lasts for 1448 bytes, the text of the Bill of Rights takes up 4 segments (or 3 + $\frac{(4500-1448-14480-517)}{1448} = 3.75$ segments);

% \end{enumerate}


% \section{HTML Documents with Embedded Objects}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[16] How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? To which 
%     Internet addresses were these GET requests sent

%     \textbf{Answer:} Totally there are 4 Get request messages. The IP Addresses are: "128.119.245.12"(First two), "178.79.137.164" and "221.81.63.166".

%     \item[17] Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or 
%     whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.

%     \textbf{Answer:} They are downloaded serially, since there is a "Connection: keep-alive" line and the time of each packet sent to the sever is strictly larger than the time recieving the response of the preview packet.

% \end{enumerate}


% \section{HTTP Authentication}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[18] What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?
%     \textbf{Answer:} \textbf{Status Code:} 401, \textbf{Phrase:} Unauthorized;
    
%     \item[19] When your browser’s sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what 
%     new field is included in the HTTP GET message?

%     \textbf{Answer:} \textbf{New Field:} "Authorization: Basic ..."
